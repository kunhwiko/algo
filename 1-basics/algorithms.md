# Algorithms 
### What are algorithms? 
-----
##### Definition
```
Algorithms are a process or procedure for a problem given certain inputs and constraints. Results for an algorithm should be reproduceable for the same inputs and steps. 
```

##### Properties 
```
The most important thing is that algorithms should be CORRECT, and then they should be EFFICIENT.

### Big O Notation 
-----
##### Big O Notation 
```
O(g(n)) tells us the "upper bound" of an algorithm's complexity. In other words, it tells us our function is "growing no faster than ...".
```

##### Big Omega Notation 
```
Ω(g(n)) tells us the "lower bound" of an algorithm's complexity. In other words, it tells us our function is "growing at least as fast as ..."
```

##### Big Theta Notation 
```
Θ(g(n)) happens only when our function is both O(g(n)) and Ω(g(n)). This is actually the closer description of complexity that we use in coding interviews.
